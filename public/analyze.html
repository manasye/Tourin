                        <p>In Tourin, we collect the data of airplane ticket from 5 big cities in Indonesia such as Jakarta,
                            Denpasar, Surabaya, Jogjakarta, and Medan. All the tickets that we collected are flights from
                            4 cities that are going to Jakarta. We choose these 5 cities because of course they're big cities
                            and therefore have the busiest flights. And the reason why we choose Jakarta as the destination
                            is because it is the capital city of Indonesia and there are more flight going to Jakarta compared
                            to other cities. Another reason we choose Jakarta as departure city is because its distinguished
                            airlines that could help creating a legible data analysis.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-9">
                        <p> From these data, we quite sure to make generalize judgement for all the domestic flight in Indonesia.
                            We scraped these tickets from a well known indonesian online travel booking website, tiket.com.
                            Data collected consist of the information about departure city, arrival city, departure time,
                            arrival time, price, and airline. Then from those data, we visualize it into graphs (bar chart,
                            pie chart, and line chart). The graphs includes total ticket based on departure city, total ticket
                            based on flight company, price based on departure city, average price based on airline.</p>

                        <p>As the goals of this porject is to have better understanding to when is the best time to book a flight,
                            we will be more focusing on price based on departure city graph. Our data is collected 30 days
                            before the departure date. We see that average price a flight goes to jakarta from 4 those cities
                            increase significantly 8 days before the departure date. While 30 - 9 days before the departure
                            date also have increasing trend but not really significant. This fact is also supported by the
                            data of ticket availability in which we see that 4 - 1 week before the departure date, the available
                            tickets don't decreased significantly, but 3 days before the departure date, the availability
                            of ticket drop.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-9">
                        <p>According to data we've collected ,we could summarize that the best time to book a ticket is around
                            30-8 days before the departure date. We can also summarize that Lion Air and Air Asia dominate
                            budget flight from those 4 cities to Jakarta. Lion Air dominate 3 cities, whereas Air Asia with
                            1 city. If we see the ticket's price fluctuation, Garuda Indonesia has the most stable price
                            as the fact that its price doesn't increase significantly even 1 week before the departure date.
                            This information could also be a consideration for choosing an airline.</p>
